# You ARE going to win!

Project for Python programming class (UNG)-
this project is meant to apply basic math functions to give you those winning lottery numbers!

The desire to create this useful gadget comes from a lot of wasted money. I've played, and I've lost when it comes to playing powerball. Anyone can win at a scratch off, your chances of winning something on a $1 scratch off is approximatley 1:4 depending on the game. When it comes to powerball your chances are 1:292,201,338 to hit the jackpot. Those are some slim odds. But, what if you could use Python to give you the upper hand on the odds? The ultimate goal for the code is to create a list of 6 numbers, 5 of which are you regular numbers, and the sixth is the powerball.

To get the ball rolling...

The original goal of this project was to take past winning numbers from the Powerball game and have my code return the 6 most common numbers. This turned into quite a challenge and was soon abandonned. 

New goal of project was to create a code that would be an at home random number selector. This code would display a list/lists of numbers that contained 6 random numbers ranging from 1-69. After running the code it should prompt the user with a question, "How many times are you going to play?" The user would put a number of his/her choosing and the code would generate that many sets. 

Problems with my code: not sure if the code will generate duplicates (this can not happen in the real game), the code is not useful for anyone other than someone who wants the code to generate the numbers at home instead of using the autmotaed generator provided at the store you buy the ticket at.
